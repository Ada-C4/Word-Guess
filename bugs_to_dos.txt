* Need to return list of already guessed letters
* Need to sanitize user input
* Add more words to random work

Optional:
* Don't penalize for guessing the same letter more than once
* Add difficulty levels (harder levels have words with more letters)
* Allow the user to enter a whole word as input (of they think they know the answer)
